            My name is Esha Reddy Annapureddy. I hold a Master’s degree in Business Analytics, with a strong focus on leveraging data to drive strategic decisions in supply chain management. 
            My academic and practical experience has shaped my passion for optimizing operations through demand forecasting, procurement strategy, and inventory management.<br>

            I’m particularly skilled at using tools like SQL, Excel, and Power BI to translate complex datasets into actionable insights.
            I’ve also gained hands-on experience with ERP systems such as Oracle SCM and SAP, which has enhanced my ability to work efficiently across procurement and planning functions. 
            My goal is to contribute to cross-functional teams by delivering data-driven solutions that improve efficiency, reduce costs, and support continuous improvement in supply chain processes.<br>
